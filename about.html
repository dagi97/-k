         Hi there! I'm a passionate and ambitious third-
         year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa
         University. Born and raised in Addis Ababa, I've
         always been driven by a deep curiosity for
         technology and innovation. My academic journey
         has provided me with a strong foundation in
         software development, and I’m eager to apply my
         knowledge to real-world projects that make a
         positive impact.Outside of tech, I find balance through my love for baking, where I enjoy experimenting with recipes and creating unique flavors. When I’m not immersed in code or the kitchen, you’ll likely find me engaged in outdoor activities—hiking, walking, or just soaking up the natural beauty around Addis Ababa. Spending time outdoors helps me stay energized, and I’m always up for new adventures with friends and family. I also believe in making time to connect with the people I love; whether it's a casual hangout or a planned event, I cherish those moments that bring joy and laughter.
